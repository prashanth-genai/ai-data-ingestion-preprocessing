Real-world AI data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline using Python
# AI Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

## Problem
Raw data received for AI models often contains invalid records that must be cleaned before training.

## Solution
This project implements a Python-based data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline using OOP, exception handling, and file I/O.

## Concepts Covered
- Python data structures
- OOP
- Exception handling
- File handling
- Feature normalization

## Real-World Usage
Used before ML model training in recommendation systems, churn prediction, and analytics pipelines.
